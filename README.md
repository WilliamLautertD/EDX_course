# ML201 Final Project

###Instructions 

**Task:**input a named vector gene expression values and predicts what call type it is. 
Optionally, provide a probability for each of the 10 possible cell types. 

**Dataset:**To develop this function you can use the pbmc_facs$counts and pbmc_facs$samples$celltype dataset we worked on during class. You can load the dataset using this line of code after installing the fastTopics package:

data("pbmc_facs", package = "fastTopics"
